	   <li>Recent project activities working on a printed circuit board that will accompany the project with Eagle CAD software.</li>
	   <li>I was having trouble designing the printed circuit board so I visited the Prototype Lab on Monday, November 14th, 2016 for some help. I received guidance, corrected my design, and I am hoping to have the printed circuit board within the week. The accompaniment of the printed circuit board will allow me to create a tidier looking circuit.</li>
	   <li>After I receive the printed circuit board I will be able to move forward with cutting the acrylic case for the project since I will have the final dimensions. After the case is complete I will be able to buy the components for the finished project such as stand-offs, shrink tubing, etc.</li>
	   <li>Completing the printed circuit board will bring me closer to meeting the objectives of the project as defined in the approved approval. Notable upcoming tasks include calibrating the reading for solar cell output voltage and light level, pushing the data into a database, and cutting an acrylic case for the project.</li>
	   <li>There are no financial updates. No money has been spent since the last update. I must purchase the stackable GPIO header and connectors for my printed circuit board. Staff at the prototype lab has told me they will provide me with the SKU’s for the components when I pick up the printed circuit board. As stated in the last progress report I expect to buy some components for the finished project such as stand-offs, shrink tubing, etc.</li>

    <li>Submitted Status Report - <a href="https://github.com/steve-spiteri/steve-spiteri.github.io/blob/master/w10/StatusReportNov7.docx?raw=true">StatusReportNov7</a></li>
	<li>Recent project activities include a placard to be used in the open house demonstration on Saturday, November 12th 2016 and a thirty second build video showcasing the major components used, assembly, power up, and the functionality I plan to demonstrate at the open house. Completing the placard and thirty second are defined in the project schedule Week 8 lines 26 through 27 – Week 9 lines 28 through 30.</li>
	<li>I have successfully assembled a circuit connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 that is able to accurately read temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude, and sea-level pressure. The circuit reads output voltage produced by the solar cell and light level but it requires some calibration as the reading does not accurately represent the correct value. I will not be able to attend the open house on Saturday November 12th due to personal reasons but I am hoping my group member, Salvatore Angilletta, will be able to inquire with Vincent Shaikh about the use of a light meter so that we can calibrate the light levels.</li>
	<li>As I was constructing the circuit that was outlined in the fritzing diagram provided last updated I noticed an opportunity of improvement. I was able to modify the circuit to include the sensor hat. This creates a tidier looking circuit. The project has been modified to include the sensor hat.
	<p>Here is an image of the circuit including the sensor hat. 
	<p><img src="https://github.com/steve-spiteri/steve-spiteri.github.io/blob/master/w10/wsensorhat.jpg?raw=true"></p></p></li>
	<li>Completing the circuit has brought me closer to meeting the objectives of the project as defined in the approved approval. Notable upcoming tasks include the possibly printing a secondary circuit board to complement the sensor hat to allow a more complete package, calibrating the reading for solar cell output voltage and light level, pushing the data into a database, and cutting an acrylic case for the project.</li>
	<li>There are no financial updates. No money has been spent since the last update. I expect to buy some components for the finished project such as stand-offs, shrink tubing, etc.</li>

    <li>Recent project activities include the 30 second build video</li>
    <li>The entire group met this week to finanlize the circuit design and put together the individual 30 second build video. All sensors are working properly and displaying readings to the Raspberry Pi terminal.
     Two values still need some attention, converting light levels to lux and accuratly intrepreting the voltage of the solar cell.
     Below you will find the 30 second build video. All three members kept the same format for consitency. Richard Burak and Salvatore Angilletta helped me in filming.
     Music used in the video is by Genetix - My 30 second life!, a chiptune from the demo scene. Upcoming hurdles including putting the data into the database, and the case.</li>

    <li>Submitted Status Report - <a href="https://github.com/steve-spiteri/steve-spiteri.github.io/blob/master/w6/StatusReportOct11.docx?raw=true">StatusReportOct11</a></li>
 	  <li>Recent project activities include research on the individual sensors to be used and the initial construction. The initial construction is complete, meeting the mechanically assemble milestone as outlined by the project schedule Week 6 lines 16 through 20. </li>
    <li>Testing of the sensors will be performed in the lab period, Tuesday October 11th, 2016, in anticipation for the power up milestone. I must ensure the sensors or solar panel will not exceed an output greater than 3.3v as to not damage the Raspberry Pi 3. </li>
    <li>The completion of the initial construction has brought me closer to meeting the objectives of the project as defined in the approved approval. Notable upcoming tasks include the completion of the PCB sensor hat fabrication, program the code that will get the data from the sensors/solar panel, establish the database connection, and apply the finishing touches to the hardware.</li>
    <li>Completing the PCB sensor hat by Week 6 as outlined by the project schedule will prove to be difficult with my current class schedule and the shortened week due to Thanksgiving. To address this, I plan on spending all the day in the prototype lab on Friday October 14th, 2016.</li>
    <li>Financial updates are detailed below, with a brief commentary where significant variances exist from the budget. As a reminder the budget was approved for $261.77. I am currently under budget by $104.40.
    <ul><li>$157.37 has been spent so far. This includes the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Complete Starter Kit from CanaKit; An Octopus Barometric Pressure Sensor Brick, Electronic Brick DHT11 Humidity/Temperature Sensor, mini photocell light sensor, and 100g lead free solder from Robotshop.com; and lastly, mini solar panel and #22 gauge hook up wire from Sayal Electronics.</li>
     <li>As mentioned in the last status report the motion sensor was removed, subtracting $14.81 from the total</li>
     <li>Components to finish the project (nylon screws, nylon standoffs, shrink tubing) have not yet been purchased.</li>
     <li>$25.08 was saved by taking advantage of a free shipping promotion and ordering the sensors with classmates from Robotshop.com.</li>
     <li>$24.47 was saved by being able to borrow wire strippers and pencil soldering iron from my father.</li></ul></li>

  A resistor in series to protect the Pi to GPIO 27 (pin 13). Testing needs to be  complete to determine which resistor is needed.</p>
<p>With the above information I was able to  prepare the following diagram that outlines the initial construction. Sensors  identical to the ones I purchased were not available so I used generic ones.</p>
