    <li>Recent project activities include the 30 second build video</li>
    <li>The entire group met this week to finanlize the circuit design and put together the individual 30 second build video. All sensors are working properly and displaying readings to the Raspberry Pi terminal.
     Two values still need some attention, converting light levels to lux and accuratly intrepreting the voltage of the solar cell.
     Below you will find the 30 second build video. All three members kept the same format for consitency. Richard Burak and Salvatore Angilletta helped me in filming.
     Music used in the video is by Genetix - My 30 second life!, a chiptune from the demo scene. Upcoming hurdles including putting the data into the database, and the case.</li>

   <ul>
    <li>Recent project activities include power up and testing the individual PCB. As per project schedule - Week 7 lines 21 - 25</li>
    <li>I have met the power up milestone.</li>
    <li>As described in last week's entry, completing the PCB was difficult. Extra time was alloted to completing the PCB and testing it. I am now back on schedule.</li>
    <li>No new financial updates. Nothing has been purchased since the last update.</li>

  <H3>Week 6</H3>
  <p>
   <ul>
    <li>Submitted Status Report - <a href="https://github.com/steve-spiteri/steve-spiteri.github.io/blob/master/StatusReportOct11.docx?raw=true">StatusReportOct11</a></li>
 	  <li>Recent project activities include research on the individual sensors to be used and the initial construction. The initial construction is complete, meeting the mechanically assemble milestone as outlined by the project schedule Week 6 lines 16 through 20. </li>
    <li>Testing of the sensors will be performed in the lab period, Tuesday October 11th, 2016, in anticipation for the power up milestone. I must ensure the sensors or solar panel will not exceed an output greater than 3.3v as to not damage the Raspberry Pi 3. </li>
    <li>The completion of the initial construction has brought me closer to meeting the objectives of the project as defined in the approved approval. Notable upcoming tasks include the completion of the PCB sensor hat fabrication, program the code that will get the data from the sensors/solar panel, establish the database connection, and apply the finishing touches to the hardware.</li>
    <li>Completing the PCB sensor hat by Week 6 as outlined by the project schedule will prove to be difficult with my current class schedule and the shortened week due to Thanksgiving. To address this, I plan on spending all the day in the prototype lab on Friday October 14th, 2016.</li>
    <li>Financial updates are detailed below, with a brief commentary where significant variances exist from the budget. As a reminder the budget was approved for $261.77. I am currently under budget by $104.40.
    <ul><li>$157.37 has been spent so far. This includes the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Complete Starter Kit from CanaKit; An Octopus Barometric Pressure Sensor Brick, Electronic Brick DHT11 Humidity/Temperature Sensor, mini photocell light sensor, and 100g lead free solder from Robotshop.com; and lastly, mini solar panel and #22 gauge hook up wire from Sayal Electronics.</li>
     <li>As mentioned in the last status report the motion sensor was removed, subtracting $14.81 from the total</li>
     <li>Components to finish the project (nylon screws, nylon standoffs, shrink tubing) have not yet been purchased.</li>
     <li>$25.08 was saved by taking advantage of a free shipping promotion and ordering the sensors with classmates from Robotshop.com.</li>
     <li>$24.47 was saved by being able to borrow wire strippers and pencil soldering iron from my father.</li></ul></li>

      A capacitor will charge at a rate variable with the amount of light    hitting the photocell. The program will return the time the capacitor took to    charge. That will be matched with a lux value to identify day, night, and    dusk/dawn. Many freeware Android applications exist to measure lux.</p></td>

  Solar Panel<br>
  A resistor in series to protect the Pi to GPIO 27 (pin 13). Testing needs to be  complete to determine which resistor is needed.</p>
<p>With the above information I was able to  prepare the following diagram that outlines the initial construction. Sensors  identical to the ones I purchased were not available so I used generic ones.</p>
