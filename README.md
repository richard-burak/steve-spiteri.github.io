Proposal
========

*Proposal for the development of a solar panel project*

Prepared by Steven Spiteri, Richard Burak, Salvatore Angilletta  
*Computer Engineering Technology Students*

**Executive Summary**
---------------------

As student’s in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with various sensors. The database will store historical production and
weather data. The mobile device functionality will include the ability to view
the system status, DC output power overview, weather factors, past power
production data and will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal.
This semester I plan to continue working with Richard Burak and Salvatore
Angilletta, who also built similar hardware last term and have worked on the
mobile application. The hardware has been completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application has been completed in
CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together this term in CENG
355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 3 student group.

**Background**
--------------

The problem solved by project is how to track a solar panel system. With the
purposed hardware and companion mobile application it will allow solar panel
owner the ability to easily monitor their system status, track their power
production, view historical production data, and view weather data from a web
interface and simple mobile application.

The hardware, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3, will operate in series with a solar
panel system. Information will be gathered to indicate if all is well with the
system and power production overview. Multiple sensors such as temperature,
humidity, barometric sensors will be used to gather weather data. Weather data
will be available to view at a glance and historically. With this data you
understand performance variations day to day.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read three which provide insight into
similar efforts.

The first journal discusses how shade can reduce power generation up to 10-20%
annually.[@6892936]

The second journal discusses low cost options for measuring solar panel defects.
[@5762585]

The third and final journal we found provides information about how extreme high
temperature can affect solar panel degradation. [@7072567]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**
---------------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding remarks**
----------------------

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for solar panel
interactive display. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and
skills developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project.
I request approval of this project.
