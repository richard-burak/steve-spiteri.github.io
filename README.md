Approved Proposal
=================

*Proposal for the development of a solar panel project*

Prepared by Steven Spiteri, Richard Burak, Salvatore Angilletta

**Executive Summary**
---------------------

As student’s in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with various sensors. The database will store historical production and
weather data. The mobile device functionality will include the ability to view
the system status, DC output power overview, weather factors, past power
production data and will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal.
This semester I plan to continue working with Richard Burak and Salvatore
Angilletta, who also built similar hardware last term and have worked on the
mobile application. The hardware has been completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application has been completed in
CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together this term in CENG
355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 3 student group.

**Background**
--------------

The problem solved by project is how to track a solar panel system. With the
purposed hardware and companion mobile application it will allow solar panel
owner the ability to easily monitor their system status, track their power
production, view historical production data, and view weather data from a web
interface and simple mobile application.

The hardware, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3, will operate in series with a solar
panel system. Information will be gathered to indicate if all is well with the
system and power production overview. Multiple sensors such as temperature,
humidity, barometric sensors will be used to gather weather data. Weather data
will be available to view at a glance and historically. With this data you
understand performance variations day to day.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read three which provide insight into
similar efforts.

The first journal discusses how shade can reduce power generation up to 10-20%
annually.[@6892936]

The second journal discusses low cost options for measuring solar panel defects.
[@5762585]

The third and final journal we found provides information about how extreme high
temperature can affect solar panel degradation. [@7072567]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**
---------------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

=======================================

2.1 Product Introduction
------------------------

 

### 2.1.1 Purpose

This product is to be used in tandem with a solar power generation system. It is
meant to enhance solar panel ownership by providing an intuitive way of
gathering and examining data for both home owners and researchers.

 

### 2.1.2 Intended Audience

This document is intended for industry professionals and educational
institutions for research and evaluation.

 

### 2.1.3 Product Scope

The product is built using a Broadcom development platform to interface with a
solar cell and a variety of sensors. All of the data is gathered using these
on-board sensors, which collect information about the humidity, temperature,
barometric pressure, and light level around the hardware. Because the power
generation of the solar cell is also tracked, it can be correlated with the
weather data and used to further our research into solar energy.

 

2.2 Overall Description
-----------------------

 

### 2.2.1 Product Perspective

This product is aimed to be a new way to gather and display data from any
existing solar power generation system.

 

### 2.2.2 Product Functions

The various sensors are tasked with gathering the raw data. The DHT-11 is used
for humidity, the BMP085 for barometric pressure and temperature, the YL-40 for
light-levels, and finally a solar cell may be connected and have its voltage
generation measured. The development platform contains software to convert this
raw data into readable values. These values are then uploaded to a remote
database for future access. This database can be read using either the Android
application or the online web interface.

 

### 2.2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The expected user of this product is any homeowner with a private solar power
generation system. The software interface is geared towards being simple and
accessible for casual smartphone users. A secondary user base can include
researchers looking to further work in solar panel technology.

 

### 2.2.4 Operating Environment

The mobile application must run on Android API 19 and above, on either a
smartphone or tablet device. The software running on the development platform is
designed to work with a Linux-based operating system. Finally, the database uses
MySQL and is accessed with PHP scripts.

 

### 2.2.5 User Documentation

Users will have access to hardware build instructions that provide a
step-by-step guide for putting the product together. Instructions for the Linux
software configuration are included as part of the build instructions.

 

2.3 External Interface Requirements
-----------------------------------

 

### 2.3.1 Database

The MySQL database will run on a co-located free-hosting website. The database
will use phpMyAdmin to for administrative interaction on the front-end. The
information contained includes formatted data downloaded from the development
platform. There are two tables, one with a username and password for the Android
app users, and on with entries for all the weather data collected (power,
temperature, light, barometric pressure, humidity, and time). The database will
be populated by data downloaded from the hardware.

(Developed by Richard Burak)

 

### 2.3.2 Mobile Application

The mobile application, available on Android platforms, will take the data from
the MySQL database and temporarily store it on the target device in memory. It
will display the data in an easy-to-read manner for the end user. There is the
option to view the data in a graph. The user can customize to see a different
range of historical data. The application has a total of three activities:
login, main and a settings. The login activity allows the user to log into an
account and have access to their data. The main activity has two areas; The main
area contains the user’s homepage and the other contains the graph. The settings
activity allows the user to change the temperature notation from Celsius to
Fahrenheit.

(Developed by Salvatore Angilletta)

 

### 2.3.3 Online Web Interface

An online web interface will be developed and mirror the functionality of the
mobile application. After the user logs in they will have access to their data
in an easy-to-read manner. On a single page, the web interface will contain the
users most recent data and a table containing historical data. An option will be
available for the user to change the temperature notation from Celsius to
Fahrenheit.

(Developed by Steven Spiteri)

 

### 2.3.4 Additional Hardware

A new top for the product casing will be 3-D printed to allow mounting of the
solar cell and allow routing for the solar cell connection.

 

(Developed by Steven Spiteri, Richard Burak, and Salvatore Angilletta)

 

2.4 Other Non-Functional Requirements
-------------------------------------

 

### 2.4.1 Safety Requirements

-   This product shall only be connected to an external power supply rated at 5
    Volts DC.

-   This product is intended to accompany solar power generation systems,
    therefore requires a trained professional when dealing with high voltage
    equipment.

-   To avoid malfunction or damage do not expose it to water, moisture or place
    on a conductive surface whilst in operation.

-   Do not use this product for anything outside it’s intended purpose.

 

### 2.4.2 Security Requirements

-   Do not share your identity authentication and password.

-   Keep software up-to-date to ensure proper operation.
